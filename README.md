# Personal portfolio — Joel Rajah

This repository now contains a simple React-based personal portfolio built with Create React App and deployed to GitHub Pages.

Quick commands

```bash
# Install deps
npm install

# Start dev server
npm start

# Build for production
npm run build

# Deploy to GitHub Pages (already configured)
npm run deploy
```

What's included

- `src/App.js` — main portfolio layout (Hero, About, Projects, Contact)
- `src/components/ProjectCard.js` — small reusable project card component
- `src/data/projects.js` — sample project entries
- `package.json` — contains `homepage` and `deploy` scripts for gh-pages

Edit `src/data/projects.js` and add your projects, descriptions, and links. Update the contact email in `src/App.js`.

If you'd like, I can:

- Add more sections (skills, blog links, resume download)
- Improve styling and animations
- Migrate this site from CRA to Vite for a faster dev experience
